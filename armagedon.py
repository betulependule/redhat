"""
This is a code that includes creating, (and most importantly) slaying animals
for fun. Viewer discretion is advised.

The first function called "genesis" uses a template and randomly chooses
from choices given to it, whilst creating a bunch of animals.

The second function called "armagedon" drowns animals according to
a death rate that is given to it.

The third function called "hunter" uses a hunter as a tool to massacre
certain animals with 50% accuracy.

Author's note: Enjoy!
